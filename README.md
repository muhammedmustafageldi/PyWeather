# PyWeather App 🌦️

This project is a Python application that uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch and display current weather data for a specified location in a graphical user interface using the Tkinter library.

## Project Description

This weather app provides users with up-to-date weather information for a selected location. The application displays the following weather data:

- Temperature (°C)
- Wind Speed (m/s)
- Pressure (hPa)
- Humidity (%)

Users can enter a city name or coordinates through the app's interface to view weather data for their chosen location.

## Features

- Encrypt and secure your notes by providing a title, text, and password.
- Save encrypted notes to a specified file path.
- Decrypt and read saved notes using your password.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Tkinter (Used for creating the graphical user interface)
- Requests (Used for making API calls)

## Requirements
